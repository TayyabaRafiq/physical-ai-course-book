## Prompt

Module 2: The Digital Twin. This specification defines the requirements for creating an accurate simulation environment using Gazebo for rigid-body physics and Unity for high-fidelity rendering, including VSLAM-ready LiDAR, Depth Camera, and IMU sensor models.

## Response snapshot

The detailed specification for "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" has been successfully created and saved to `specs/001-digital-twin-simulation/spec.md`. A corresponding quality checklist `specs/001-digital-twin-simulation/checklists/requirements.md` has also been generated and marked as complete.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive specification for Module 2 created, covering physics simulation, high-fidelity rendering, and sensor models, aligning with user requirements.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run for this command.
- 📁 Files: Created `specs/001-digital-twin-simulation/spec.md` and `specs/001-digital-twin-simulation/checklists/requirements.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for `/sp.plan` or further clarification.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully defined detailed user stories, functional requirements, key entities, and measurable success criteria for the module. All checklist items passed.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
