## Prompt

Digital Twin Architecture

## Response snapshot

ADR-0001: Digital Twin Architecture (Gazebo & Unity Integration) has been created to document the architectural decisions for the Digital Twin module, including the integration of Gazebo, Unity, and ROS 2 Python.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a formal Architecture Decision Record for the Digital Twin Architecture, enhancing documentation and alignment.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run for this command.
- 📁 Files: Created history/adr/0001-digital-twin-architecture-gazebo-unity-integration.adr.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for task list generation or implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully identified significant architectural decision and created a well-structured ADR, adhering to the specified format.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Bash script execution failures (create-adr.sh and check-prerequisites.ps1) were encountered due to environment limitations, necessitating manual ADR creation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
